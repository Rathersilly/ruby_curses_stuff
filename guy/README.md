# fooling around making a graphics library with curses

Notes:
some algorithms use rounding and others use an error
variable.  possibly one is better than the other, but
at the very least i feel like they should be consistent

there is a growing collection of algos that do the same
thing (deliberately).  They should be benchmarked, esp
including versions that store each pixel.  I feel that
that is a good approach for terminal resolution (if not
for higher resolutions)
