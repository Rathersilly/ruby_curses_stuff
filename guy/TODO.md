shape.rb:
circle function is symmetrical for nls 80-120 step 4
EXCEPT 88, which is a pixel off - so close lol

add attributes to shapes in hash form
squishing: add hsquish and vsquish

add keyboard controls and selection menu

filling - could be possible to fill with an invisible
character to signal things ie collision/vision

input: need to get timeout and sleeps working nicely
would like to implement it like callbacks

using the Point class as argument might make things
clearer
